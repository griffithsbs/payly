## payly

A library of React components for use in applications that are concerned with paying people and getting paid by people.

### TODO
1. The domain is too high-level to implement without a flux-like, and therefore a purely React component library won't be very useful. Either turn this into a library of React-Redux components, or abandon the library idea and incorporate this project into the application.
2. cover all non-throwaway code with tests
3. make a start on styling
4. write a proper harness
5. write scripts to (i) build, (ii) test, (iii) watch, and (iv) start harness
